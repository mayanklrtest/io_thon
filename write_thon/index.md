# The Next Big Thing in Marketing

Marketing is going to change drastically in 2020. And yes, we mean changes from a competition standpoint. 

After all, it is no rocket science that each year marketing gets more expensive and more competitive. That’s just a given! 

Moreover, a solid customer experience strategy might just be the difference between your brand and your closest competitor in 2020. Therefore, at the very best, marketers should spot a new way to gain an edge over competitors. 

So, what is the next big thing in marketing? We explore some possible theories.

# Top marketing trends to look for in 2020

# 1. AI will develop within the customer service space.

The modern consumer is looking for new ways to be impressed — not with gimmicks, but with convenience.

According to Conversocial, nearly 66% of customers switch brands because they’ve experienced poor customer service.

The IoT-era, with its smart speakers and intelligent refrigerators, has brought us a hyper-connected world of real-time experiences and instantaneous responsive feedback. Plus, with 5G on the way, you can expect consumers to expect things even faster before the end of 2020.

What more?

Expect more brands to utilize social messaging alongside AI and chatbots in 2020 to help plug this speed gap. Social messaging, like Facebook Messenger and Twitter, is ushering a new generation of customers who expect more and want things to be done fast.

And by combining both AI and chatbot technology with social messaging, brands will be able to automate and personalize their responses.

How to leverage this trend: Experiment with emerging technologies such as digital signage, smart speakers, and wearables.

# 2. Voice commerce will come of age.

Voice assistant technology is already showing strong rates of adoption. The Amazon Alexa Skills marketplace has over 50,000 skills worldwide, which is a steep jump from the 30,000 milestones that were achieved in March, earlier this year.

Along with this rapid adoption of voice-activated speakers, we have also seen a drastic change in consumer behavior. Think with Google states that 72% of people who own a voice-activated speaker say that their devices are used as part of their daily routine.

To keep up with this trend, brands will need to invest in a headless commerce solution to make their products and shopping experiences available on a broader range of platforms; from voice-enabled speakers to kiosk screens and everything in between.

How to leverage this trend: Get ahead with headless commerce

# 3. Customers will expect hyper-personalized experiences.

In a report by Internet Retailing, 69% of consumers want to have a personalized experience, yet less than 50% of brands are actually delivering.

Consumers have now become used to brands reaching out to them in personal ways. This includes personalized emails and newsletters and product recommendations that have been formulated from the consumer’s previous purchases.

Customers love this kind of service because they’re getting what they want without having to say a word.

As more IoT devices become available, brands will have access to more in-depth data about their customers than ever before. They can leverage this data to identify the customer’s pain points, buying habits, and interactions they had with agents from the past to deliver a highly personalized service. 

How to leverage this trend: Personalize the customer experience based on user behavior

# 4. More brands will step into augmented reality.

Augmented Reality overlays information and visuals onto a real-world setting. Many early adopters are following the AR trend for product demonstrations and provide support.

Leading cosmetics firm L’Oreal utilizes AR technology to help shoppers “try on” different makeup colors and looks, without having to apply any cosmetic products. Users can see how their furnishing will look in the comfort of their homes. 

IKEA’s augmented reality app is another example. The furniture retailer released an app that allows customers to virtually visualize products in their personal living and workspaces, so they can see the finished product before they purchase.

With 5G coming into the mix very soon, which has been predicted to provide speeds of up to 10Gbps and barely noticeable latency, we expect to see more brands experiment in delivering AR experiences across non-WiFi areas.

How to leverage this trend: Experiment with an AR app

# 5. More focus on omnichannel delivery.

Omnichannel delivery provides consumers with a consistent experience from touchpoint to touchpoint. For example, if a customer started their interaction with your brand on social media, this experience would continue as the customer moves onto your mobile app and website.

And as the IoT-era will transform more objects into connected devices, customers will continue to expect the same experience, whether that is through connected cars, smart TVs, and appliances.

# 6. Biometric Authentication will go mainstream.

As many corporate breaches have illustrated - and continue to show - traditional passwords are no match for hackers who are adept at breaking into password databases and stealing privileged login credentials. 

For many enterprises out there, the inherent vulnerability of legacy authentication solutions is fueling a push toward biometric authentication, which is seen as a technology that is more uniquely suited than passwords to match today's cyber threat atmosphere.

Furthermore, because hackers cannot phish biometrics, it can be the most impeccable feature of your identity and access management solution, making a significant contribution to organizational security.

# 7. Increased security measures.

To support the increasing demand for personalization, brands need to attain more data about their consumers. For some, knowing that a brand is holding so much data about them can make them feel nervous.

As we head into 2020, brands will continue to find ways to further protect their data by upping their security protocols or shifting to a cloud-based infrastructure that provides a much better and more comprehensive data management.

Also speaking of security measures…

# GDPR and CCPA: The next wave of consumer data privacy regulations

In a world where data is the most valuable resource, it’s logical that there will be new regulations to protect consumer data. With media outlets covering more data scandal stories than ever, consumers are increasingly more aware of data collection and how it affects them. 

With this in mind, global compliance regulations support consumer rights to data privacy and consent.

Two such regulations are the EU’s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation, in effect May 25, 2018) and the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act, in effect January 1, 2020). These are two of the first regulations that directly impact data collection, use, and storage on a widespread scale. 

Understanding the impact of GDPR and CCPA regulations is crucial for global compliance in 2020. In fact, these regulations foreshadow a certain trend toward data collection and management.

More governing bodies will implement privacy and consent regulations with heftier repercussions for noncompliance.

To help you understand how these regulations can affect you, here’s an overview of GDPR vs. CCPA.

Amidst all good, we have a bummer too. And yes, it is another big thing in marketing to watch out for in 2020.

# Prediction: 2020 - The Year of Disinformation

We used to complain that it was too hard to get information.  In 2020, we’ll have to watch out for too much of the wrong information.  

According to the Guardian, many already got a taste of “disinformation” in 2016. The publication reports that the small town of Veles in Macedonia was the registered home of about 100 pro-Trump websites, many of them sharing disinformation. 

In 2019, 70 countries were the victims of misinformation campaigns (up from 28 countries in 2017).

So, while US voters should probably scrutinize who they get information from before they elect their next president in 2020, the rest of the world is not immune to false information.

Social media companies and governments are taking action: Facebook and Google have said that they will disclose the creators of political ads.  Twitter has said that it will ban all political ads. 

Note: Countries like Singapore, France, and Malaysia have enacted laws to deal with disinformation.

And according to Gartner’s Chief of Research, news organizations’ IT and content production groups will team up and use blockchain to ensure the authenticity of their published content. 

# Conclusion

2020 will be a pivotal year for marketing. It is time for your brand to take a good honest look at your current infrastructure. Some of the trends will require you to invest in a multi-tenant headless infrastructure that allows you to deliver omnichannel experiences, voice commerce, AR, and staff training portals all from a single location.

Ideally, you’ll also want a Customer Identity and Access Management solution, which looks after maintenance, upgrades, and security. 

Leaving you with more time to focus on delivering an excellent customer experience.
